Question One: num_loop.sh

#!/bin/bash

for num in {1..20}
do
  echo "$num"
  if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "I'm big!"
  fi
done

Question Two
Part (a): Script with Arguments

#!/bin/bash

echo "Your first name: $1"
echo "Your last name: $2"
echo "You're enrolled in: $3"
echo "You're in year: $4"

To run the script, you would call it with four arguments, like so:

./script_name.sh John Doe Computer_Science 3

Part (b): Script with User Input
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter your first name: " first_name
read -p "Enter your last name: " last_name
read -p "Enter your program: " program
read -p "Enter your year of study: " year_of_study

echo "Your first name: $first_name"
echo "Your last name: $last_name"
echo "You're enrolled in: $program"
echo "You're in year: $year_of_study"

Question Three: Directory and File Check Script
#!/bin/bash

# Check if directory exists, if not create it
if [ ! -d "/home/ubuntu/access" ]; then
  echo "Directory does not exist. Creating it..."
  mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/access
fi

# Check if file exists, if not create it
if [ ! -f "/home/ubuntu/access/myscript.sh" ]; then
  echo "File does not exist. Creating it..."
  touch /home/ubuntu/access/myscript.sh
fi
