Step 1: Create a Hidden Folder my-scripts under /root and Set Ownership to Root
# Create a hidden folder under /root called 'my-scripts'
mkdir /root/.my-scripts

# Change ownership to root (this step may already be done by default)
chown root:root /root/.my-scripts

Step 2: Create a Bash Script apt-update.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the current user is root
if [ "$(whoami)" != "root" ]; then
  echo "You must run this script as root."
  exit 1
fi

# Run apt update and redirect errors to /dev/null
apt update 2>/dev/null

Step 3: Create a Systemd Service File on-boot.service
# Create the systemd service file
touch /etc/systemd/system/on-boot.service

# Open the file in a text editor
nano /etc/systemd/system/on-boot.service

Add the following content to the on-boot.service file:
[Unit]
Description=Run apt update on boot
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/bash /root/.my-scripts/apt-update.sh
Type=simple
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Step 4: Reload systemd and Enable the Service
# Reload systemd to read the new service file
systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable the service to start on boot
systemctl enable on-boot.service

# Start the service immediately (optional)
systemctl start on-boot.service


Step 5: Verify the Service
# Check the status of the systemd service
systemctl status on-boot.service
